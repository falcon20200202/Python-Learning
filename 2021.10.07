今天学习了列表的创建、对列表元素进行操作、组织列表。
列表是由一系列按特定顺序排列的元素组成。
对列表元素的操作包括了元素的修改、增加、删除。
组织列表包括了按字母排序、列表的倒序以及列表长度。

练习题如下：
#case3-1
names = ['first','second','third','forth','fifth']
print(names[0])
print(names[1])
print(names[2])
print(names[3])
print(names[4])
#case3-2
print(f'{names[0]}, good moring!')
#case3-3
ways = ['walk','run','bicycle']
print(f"I would like to own a {ways[0]}.")
#case3-4
dinner = ['first','second','third']
print(f"{dinner[0].title()}, would you like to have dinner with me? ")
#case3-5
print(f"{dinner[0].title()} can not attend")
dinner_cannot = dinner.pop(0)
dinner.insert(0,'forth')
print(f"{dinner[0].title()}, would you like to have dinner with me? ")
#case3-6
print(f"I found a bigger table! ")
dinner.insert(0,'fifth')
dinner.insert(2,'sixth')
dinner.append('seventh')
print(f"{dinner[0].title()}, would you like to have dinner with me? ")
#case3-7
print(f"I'm sorry to inform you that we can only invite two people to dinner because the new table didn't arrive in time. ")
dinner_cannot = dinner.pop(0)
print(f"{dinner_cannot.title()}, sorry, we can not have dinner together")
dinner_cannot = dinner.pop(0)
print(f"{dinner_cannot.title()}, sorry, we can not have dinner together")
dinner_cannot = dinner.pop(0)
print(f"{dinner_cannot.title()}, sorry, we can not have dinner together")
dinner_cannot = dinner.pop()
print(f"{dinner_cannot.title()}, sorry, we can not have dinner together")
print(f"{dinner[0].title()}, welcome!")
print(f"{dinner[1].title()}, welcome!")
del dinner[0]
del dinner[0]
print(dinner)
