今天学习了变量与字符串
练习题如下：
#case2-3
name = "eric"
lanuage = "Python"
print(f"Hello {name.title()}, would you like to learn some {lanuage} today?")
#case2-4
first_name = "sun"
last_name = "wu"
print(f"{first_name.upper()} {last_name.upper()}")
print(f"{first_name.lower()} {last_name.lower()}")
print(f"{first_name.title()} {last_name.title()}")
#case2-5
print('Albert Einstein once said,"A people who never made a mistike never tried anything new."')
#case2-6
famous_person = "Albert Einstein"
message = f'{famous_person} once said,"A people who never made a mistike never tried anything new."'
print(message)
#case2-7
name = "\nsun wu  \t"
print(name)
print(name.lstrip())
print(name.rstrip())
print(name.strip())

运行结果如下：
Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?
SUN WU
sun wu
Sun Wu
Albert Einstein once said,"A people who never made a mistike never tried anything new."
