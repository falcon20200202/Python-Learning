今天继续学习了while循环
练习题如下：
# case7-4
prompt = "\nPlease enter the name of topping:"
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.)"
flag = True
while flag:
    topping = input(prompt)
    if topping == 'quit':
        flag = False
    else:
        print(f"We will attend the {topping}!")
        
# case7-5
prompt = "\nPlease enter your age:"
prompt += "\n(Enter '0' when you are finished.)"
while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    age = int(age)
    if age == 0:
        break
    elif age < 3:
        price = 0
    elif (age >= 3) and (age <= 12):
        price = 10
    elif age > 12:
        price = 15
    print(f"The price is {price}.")

# case7-6
prompt = "\nPlease enter your age:"
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.)"
active = True
while active:
    age = input(prompt)
    if age == 'quit':
        active = False
    else:
        age = int(age)
        if age <= 0:
            print("Please enter a right age:")
            continue
        elif age < 3:
            price = 0
        elif (age >= 3) and (age <= 12):
            price = 10
        elif age > 12:
            price = 15
        print(f"The price is {price}.")

# case7-8
sandwich_orders = ['sandwich1', 'sandwich2', 'sandwich3']
finished_sandwichs = []
while sandwich_orders:
    sandwich = sandwich_orders.pop()
    print(f"I made your {sandwich} sandwich.")
    finished_sandwichs.append(sandwich)
print(finished_sandwichs)

# case7-9
sandwich_orders = ['sandwich1', 'pastrami', 'sandwich2', 'pastrami','sandwich3', 'pastrami']
finished_sandwichs = []
print("Pastrami has been sold out.")
while 'pastrami' in sandwich_orders:
    sandwich_orders.remove('pastrami')

while sandwich_orders:
    sandwich = sandwich_orders.pop()
    print(f"I made your {sandwich} sandwich.")
    finished_sandwichs.append(sandwich)
print(finished_sandwichs)

# case7-10
places = []
flag = True
while flag:
    places = input("If you could visit one place in the world, where would you go? ")
    print(places)
    repeat = input("Woule you like to let another person respond? (yes/ no)")
    if repeat == 'no':
        break
