今天继续学习了while循环
练习题如下：
# case7-4
prompt = "\nPlease enter the name of topping:"
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.)"
flag = True
while flag:
    topping = input(prompt)
    if topping == 'quit':
        flag = False
    else:
        print(f"We will attend the {topping}!")
        
# case7-5
prompt = "\nPlease enter your age:"
prompt += "\n(Enter '0' when you are finished.)"
while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    age = int(age)
    if age == 0:
        break
    elif age < 3:
        price = 0
    elif (age >= 3) and (age <= 12):
        price = 10
    elif age > 12:
        price = 15
    print(f"The price is {price}.")

# case7-6
